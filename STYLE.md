## Style Guide
### Variable Names
I personally use camelCasing for the naming of variables.

### Operators (space)
I always put spaces around operators, also after comma's.

### Code indentation
I use one tab (4 spaces) for code indentation.

### Line length
For readability I tend to keep lines shorter than 80 characters.
If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, I break it after an operator or a comma.

### Quotes
For strings I consequentially use single quotes, not double quotes.

### Keywords
I always use a single space after a JavaScript keyword.

### Comments
Comments do not start with a capital letter, and do not end with a dot. I try to keep my comments to a single line.

### Blank lines
More than one blank line is not allow in the JavaScript code.

### Var declarations
Each declaration of a variable is its own statement. I do not declare multiple variables on the same line/statement.

### End of file
The JavaScript file ends with a newline.
